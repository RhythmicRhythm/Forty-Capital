          The foreign exchange market with an acronym FOREX is the largest financial market with an avenue to trade currencies of all
          countries with an average of $5.3 trillion in daily transactions. The foreign exchange market is largely made up of institutional
         investors, corporates, governments, banks, as well as currency speculators. Roughly 90% of this volume is generated by currency
          speculators capitalizing on intraday price movements. Unlike the stock market and future markets that are housed in central
           physical exchanges, the foreign exchange market is an over the counter market, decentralized market completely housed
            electronically though investors are familiar with the stock market they are unaware how small in volume it is in relation to the
            Forex Market.

            <br> 

          In sum, the forex market size and depth make it the ideal trading market. This liquidity makes it easy for traders to sell and
          buy currencies this is the reason why traders from all over the world are turning to the FX Market.

        This trading currencies has been made easier in such a way that instead of having to go to the bank to do over a counter trade it
         can be done easily with access to the internet and a computer, or even a phone. Currencies are traded and leverage on the 
         difference between their prices and the difference to come to make money. These deference is the most essential and it is 
         not just predicted based on our feelings because that would make it pure gambling but predicted based on the fundamental and
          technical analysis. Thus, the foreign exchange market is the market for a national currency (foreign money) anywhere in the world,
          the foreign exchange market structure comprises of three components (buyer, centralized system and the seller)

       Forex is a portmanteau of foreign currency and exchange. Foreign exchange is the process of changing one currency into another
        currency for a variety of reasons, usually for commerce, trading, or tourism. According to a recent triennial report from the 
        Bank for International Settlements (a global bank for national central banks), the average was more than $5.1 trillion in daily 
        forex trading volume.

     The foreign exchange (also known as FX or forex) market is a global marketplace for exchanging national currencies against one
      another.
    Because of the worldwide reach of trade, commerce, and finance, forex markets tend to be the largest and most liquid asset markets
     in the world.
    Currencies trade against each other as exchange rate pairs. For example, EUR/USD.
     Forex markets exist as spot (cash) markets as well as derivatives markets offering forwards, futures, options, and currency swaps.
    Market participants use forex to hedge against international currency and interest rate risk, to speculate on geopolitical events,
     and to diversify portfolios, among several other reasons.
     <br>
     <br>

The foreign exchange market is where currencies are traded. Currencies are important to most people around the world, whether they
 realize it or not, because currencies need to be exchanged in order to conduct foreign trade and business. If you are living in the U.S.
  and want to buy cheese from France, either you or the company that you buy the cheese from has to pay the French for the cheese in
   euros (EUR). This means that the U.S. importer would have to exchange the equivalent value of U.S. dollars (USD) into euros. The same
    goes for traveling. A French tourist in Egypt can't pay in euros to see the pyramids because it's not the locally accepted currency. As 
    such, the tourist has to exchange the euros for the local currency, in this case the Egyptian pound, at the current exchange rate.

One unique aspect of this international market is that there is no central marketplace for foreign exchange. Rather, currency trading is
 conducted electronically over-the-counter (OTC), which means that all transactions occur via computer networks between traders around
  the world, rather than on one centralized exchange. The market is open 24 hours a day, five and a half days a week, and currencies are
   traded worldwide in the major financial centers of London, New York, Tokyo, Zurich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris and 
   Sydneyâ€”across almost every time zone. This means that when the trading day in the U.S. ends, the forex market begins anew in
    Tokyo and Hong Kong. As such, the forex market can be extremely active any time of the day, with price quotes changing constantly.
